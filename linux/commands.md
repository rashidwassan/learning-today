# Linux
## These are some Linux commands that I learn for DevOps.
#### Intro & Background:
In 1964, Bell labs tried to develop a multipurpose OS.
In 1969, they withdrew.
The project was a UNIX project (Uniplex Information & Computing Services), it was free for all.
Linus Torvald was a student of Helsinki University who started project Linux in 1991. At that time, UNIX was being sold very expensive.
Linux is free for all.
Linux is actually a kernel, not an OS.
Linux is open source.
Linux is lightweight.
Multi User OS.
