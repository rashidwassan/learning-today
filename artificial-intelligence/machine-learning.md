# Machine Learning

## Learning
- Learning denotes changes in a system to do the same task more efficiently next time. - (Herbert Simon)
- Making useful changes in our minds. - (Marvin Minsky)


### Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning
- Traditional programming: `data + program => Output`
- Machine Learning: `data + output => Trained Model`

## Machine Learning Definition
- Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- A computer program is said to learn form experience `E` w.r.t to task `T`, and some performance measure `P`, improves with experience `E`.
- `Wiki:` Machine Learning is subfield of Artificial Intelligence that is concerned with the design and development of the algorithms that improve over their performance over time based on data.
- Relates with: Data mining, statistics, inductive reasoning, and theoretical computer science.

## When to use ML?
- `When patterns exist in our data:`
  - Even if we don't know what they are.
- `We can not pin down the functional relationships mathematically:`
  - Or we would just code up the algorithm.
- `When we have lots of 'unlabeled' data:`
  - Data is of high dimensions.
  - Labeled data sets are harder to come by.

## Learning in AI
- Essential for unknown environments.
- Learning is useful.
- Learning can modify the agent's decision making mechanisms to improve performance.
- Understand and improve the efficiency of human learning.
- Discover new things or structure that is unknown to human.
- Fill in skeletal or incomplete information about a domain.
- Build software agents that can adapt to their users or to other agents.

## Learning Element
### Design of a learning element is affected by:
- Which components of the performance element are to be learned.
- What feedback is available to learn these components.
- What representation is used for the components.
