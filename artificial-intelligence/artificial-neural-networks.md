# Artificial Neural Networks

## Definition
Artificial Neural Networks, also called Neurocomputing or Parallel Distributed Process (PDP) or connectionist networks are interconnected assemblies of simple processing elements called neurons, or nodes, which act like a biological neuron.
## Main Features of Neural Networks
- They learn by experience rather than programming or modelling.
- ANN architectures are distributed, inherently parallel and potentially realtime.
- Have the ability to generalize.
- Do not require prior understanding of the process.
- Can form arbitrary continous non-linear mappings.
- Robust to noisy data.
- VLSI (Very large scale integration) Implementation is easy.

## Applications of ANNs
- Pattern recognition
  - Character recognition
- Speech recognition
- Face recognition
- Online signature recognition
- Color recognition
- Weather forecasting
- Load forecasting
- Intelligent routes and traffic management
- Intelligent controller design
- Intelligent modelling

## Limitations
- Conventional networks are black box models
- Tools for analysis and validation are not well established
- Only problems for which machine is trained will be solved
- Human brain cannot be fully simulated
