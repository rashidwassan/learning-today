# Artificial Neural Networks

## Main Features of Neural Networks
- They learn by experience rather than programming or modelling.
- ANN architectures are distributed, inherently parallel and potentially realtime.
- Have the ability to generalize.
- Do not require prior understanding of the process.
- Can form arbitrary continous non-linear mappings.
- Robust to noisy data.
- VLSI (Very large scale integration) Implementation is easy.

## Applications of ANNs
- Pattern recognition
  - Character recognition
- Speech recognition
- Face recognition
- Online signature recognition
- Color recognition
