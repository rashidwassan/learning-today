# Natural Language Processing

## Introduction:
- A subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with the processing of Natural Language.
- Also called Computational Linguistics.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the use of computers to process written and spoken language for some practical, useful, purpose: to translate languages, to get information from the web on text data banks so as to answer questions, to carry on conversations with machines, so as to get advice about, say, pensions and so on.

## Application Areas
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- User Interfaces
- Speech Recognition
- Spelling and Grammar Checkers
- Natural Language Interfaces

## Divisions
- Processing Written Text
- Processing Spoken Language

## Subfields
- Natural Language Generation: It is the area of NLP concern with making it easier for you to understand a computer output.
- Natural Language Understanding: Concerned with the understanding of knowledge specified in Natural Language such that the computer can use it to perform it tasks.

## Features that make it difficult or useful
- `The problems:`
  - Sentences may have incomplete meaning.
  - Different contextual meanings.
  - No complete knowledge as new words being formed.
  - Lot of ways to say something.
- `Good side:`
  - Allows speakers to be vague or precise.
  - Talking about infinite world using finite words.
  - Can evolve as our experience.
  - When you know a lot,, facts implies easily to each other.

## Other Problems in NL Understanding
- `Ambiguity: `Lexical, Syntactic, and Referential.
- `Imprecision`
- `Incompleteness`
- `Inaccuracy`
