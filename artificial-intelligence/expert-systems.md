- Used to help expert humans or used as their replacement.
- Solves the problem with tricks, shortcuts, and heuristics.

## Description
- Well designed expert systems imitate the reasoning process that experts use in problem solving.
- Such systems can be used by non experts to improve their problem solving capabilities.
- The most widely used way of representing domain knowledge in expert system is a set of `production rules`.

## Expert systems are:
- Good for: limited domains where expert information is available, providing expert opinion in remote sites. Application of heuristic knowledge.
- Not good for: reasoning, recognizing limits of their ability, handling inconsistent knowledge.
