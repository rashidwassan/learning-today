# Random Variable
### Definition:
Random variable is a real valued function whose domain is sample space. These are numerical quantities whose values depend upon a chance or the values which are obtained by outcomes of random events. Or a function whose value is a real number determined by each event in the sample space.
- Random variables are either dicrete or continous.
- A random variable is discrete, if the values it assume can be counted.
- Continous if it can assume any value within a 
- If x is a random variable and s is sample space then:
```
X: S->R
```
- Example: Toss three coins and all the available states are sample space.
