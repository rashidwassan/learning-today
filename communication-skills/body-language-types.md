# Body Language Examples

### Why body language is so important?
Body language is important because it is a silent way of communicating. It tells people what you are feeling without words. We use our body language every day without even realizing it. The way we sit, stand, walk, smile, laugh, and talk all tell other people how we feel and what we think.

## Eye Contact:
When you meet a new person, what catches your attention? Maybe you look them up and down for clues about their personality. Maybe you focus on their voice. But if you’re like most people, one of the first things you notice is their eyes.

## Eye brow raise:
- Surpised or shocked reaction, interest.

## Head Nod:
A head nod is one of the most common body language signals, and it’s probably more powerful than you think.
For example, if you’re having a conversation with someone and they are nodding along while you’re talking, it could be a sign that they’re interested in what you’re saying and like what they’re hearing.
- Affirmation

## Crossed Arms:
- Cold or uncomfortable

## Leaning in
Don’t worry! If your pal is getting up close and personal, it just means they’re into what you’re saying.
