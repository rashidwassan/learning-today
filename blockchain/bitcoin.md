## Three Networks of Bitcoin core:
- Mainnet - Primary network where all transactions take place. Coins have value, and have real peers. It provides testing environment for bitcoin applications.
- Testnet - Used for testing, coins have no value, and peers are there with no connection to mainnet. This come with shortcomings of mainnet like slow transactions and 10 min rule for block creation.
- Regnet - Used for testing, coins have no value & the network has no peers. It was created to mitigate the issues with testnet.

## Mainnet VS Testnet
- Mainnet is for production while testnet is for testing.
- Both are public.
- Mainnet has entire network peers, while testnet has only testers.
- Size (200GB vs 14GB) approx.
- 10 min for block creation on both.
- Full value vs no value. Although people have tried to collect and sell testnet coins because of their limited supply. The all coins are wiped twiced for preventing this from happening. Therefore this is testnet 3 (3rd generation).
- Public key prefix on mainnet is 1. While on testnet, it is m or n.
- Difficulty: Full vs half of the mainnet.
