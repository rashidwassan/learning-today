# Solidity Data Types

## Elementary data types

### int
    used to store integer data with the support of size specification within multiples of 8 bits.
    uint8 is of 8 bits and can store integers from 0 to 255.
    size defaults to 256bits (32 byte number).

### uint
    this is integer value which is unsigned, due to not being bound with support of negative values, it can store twice of the positive
    number values supported by int.

### address
    represents 20byte Ethereum address.
    it is of value type.
    address.balance can be used to check the balance of current account.


## Data Initializations
    int will be initialized to 0.
    bool will be initialized to false.
