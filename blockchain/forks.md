## Soft Fork: 

## Hard Fork:
- It is a large change.
- It is a permanent change, resulting in an entirely new software.
- Once a hard fork is implemented, it creates whole new network.
- Peers have options to stick with original network or go with newer one.
- If someone had 100 coins/tokens in one network, going to forked one will not change that amount, however, the value of those coins and tokens may change according to the acceptance of the network.
- The forked software is incompatible with original one.
### Example of Hard Fork:
The common example of a hard fork is Bitcoin Cash, the fork was the result of class between developers on transaction block size. When there was no settlement on one choice, the hard fork was made, distributing the developers accordingly.
