## Fundamentals of Blockchain

- The first concept of blockchain was emerged in 1990 in a research paper 'Time-Stamping of a Digital Document'
- The first block created in a blockchain is called the genesis block, having no previous block hash.
- In a blockchain, the blocks are cryptographically linked together.


## Notes from the original document 'How to time-stamp a Digital Document' published in 1991.

- In this digital world, it is necessary to know when the document was created or last modified.
- What is needed is a method of time-stamping digital documents with the following two properties. First, one must find a way to time-stamp the data itself, without any reliance on the characteristics of the medium on which the data appears, so that it is impossible to change even one bit of the document without the change being apparent. Second, it should be impossible to stamp a document with a time and date different from the actual one.
- The setting for our problem is a distributed network of users, perhaps representing individuals, different companies, or divisions within a company; we will refer to the users as clients. Each client has a unique identification number.
- A "Digital safety-deposit box" is a proposed solution. However, there are some compromises namely privacy, bandwidth and storage, incompetence, and trust are to be accepted.
- Trusted Time-Stamping Service uses some of the following techniques to improve timestamping.
- The way in which this system can be improved is to send the random string of bits (generated by cryptographic one-way functions), instead of the whole data for timestamping.
- With a secure signature scheme available, when the TSS receives the hash value, it appends the date and time, then signs this compound document and sends it to the client.

## Role of SHA256 hash in blockchain

- SHA256 was developed by NSA (National Security Agency).
