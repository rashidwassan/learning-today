## Started my journey as a DevOps learner at 15-01-2023.

What is DevOps?
-    	 Stands for (Development + Operations)
-    	Methodology to develop software.
-    	It is like an Agile or Waterfall model.
-    	SDLC terms were used before.
-    	In agile, we need only the development team.
-    	DevOps has a development, communication, & operations team.
 
Steps for Big Software Projects:
	Traditional SDLC steps.
1. 	Plan
2. 	Requirements Engineering
3. 	Code
4. 	Test
5. 	Implement
6. 	Maintenance (optional)
7. 	Monitor
 
 
How is the Waterfall Model Different?
-    	It is a sequenced model.
-    	Used in large scale development.
-    	Not so time efficient since you cannot go back in this model.
-    	Can’t be used when requirements change frequently.
-    	Provides a lot of rigidity.
-    	Three teams required for testing, RE, & planning.
 
Waterfall Model (shortcomings):
-    	High rigidity.
-    	Zero customer involvement.
-    	High risk.
Note: For overcoming these shortcomings, RAD & Spiral models were invented, but no revolutionary change took place.
 
Agile (revolutionary change):
-    	Less shortcomings.
-    	Flexible.
-    	100% customer involvement.
-    	Low risk.
-    	Waterfall is a complete entity & agile is in chunks of process, output is same in both.
-    	Allows simultaneous process flow.
-    	4th or 5th rank in industry, out of 10.
 
Why DevOps?
-    	Agile’s shortcomings.
-    	As IT Firms have both, development & operations departments.
-    	Agile solved 30% of issues according to managers, as it only dealt with the development side.
-    	Horizontal communication gaps in Agile model.
 
First Concept of DevOps:
-    	Sync up meetings: Open meeting for team leads to sit for 30 min in the morning for work updates. It was time consuming.
-    	Note: DevOps opts for merging both the teams.
-    	Scrum meetings.
-    	Standing meetings.
 
Features of DevOps:
-    	Fast delivery.
-    	Higher quality (due to automation).
-    	reduced Capex & Opex.
-    	Reduced outages.
 
Tools Used in DevOps:
-    	Development: Git, GitHub, Jenkins (QA), Maven (build), Selenium (testing).
-    	Deployment: Chef (CMS), Ansible (automation), Docker, Kubernetes; Monitor, Cloud Watch, & Nagios (maintenance).
 
DevOps Engineer:
-    	May not be a coder.
-    	Role after code.
-    	Knows Git & GitHub.
-    	Jenkins (for level interactions).
-    	Maven for building.
 
Stages of DevOps:
	There are 4 to 5 stages of DevOps.
-    	1: Version Control: Change code and update it (Version Control System is used).
-    	2: Continuous Integration: Taking code from VCS and delivering to the build engineer for builds (Maven used).
     -     3: Continuous Delivery: Maven & Selenium are used to test the build.
               The release is then sent to next department.
     -     4: Continuous Deployment: Using Chef, Docker, or Puppet the    
               deployment takes place. Either Onsite or Offshore.
               Offshore: Where you develop the code. 
               Onsite: Deployment on a physical server.


The DevOps Process Cycle Looks Like This:


As can be seen, the process is continuous


 DevOps prerequisites: 
Cloud: AWS, MS Azure, Google Cloud Platform. IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
Linux.
