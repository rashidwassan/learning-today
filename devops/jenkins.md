### What is CI/CD Pipeline?
CI/CD stands for continous integration and continous delivery/deployment.
It is a methodology of Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).
It allows you to automate the process of deployment with early stage identification of errors or bugs.

```
Version Control -> Build -> Unit Test -> Deploy -> Auto Test -> Production Env Deploy -> Measure & Validate (QA)
    |                                                                                                    |
    <----------------------------------- Production Feedback ---------------------------------------------
```
Feedback is provided on every level.

### Things before CI/CD
- Developers had to push their code to vcs.
- The code is then integrated and built in order to spot the bugs.
- The the tester would test the code.

### After CI/CD
- The code directly goes from source code repo to CI server.
- Know the errors are spotted quickly as CI Server informs the developer if there is anything wrong.
- CI server contains all the procedure of build, test, and deploy stuff.
