# Docker

- Docker can be simply explained as advanced version of virtulization.
- Docker is used for containerization.
- Container is just like a virtual machine.


### Scenario
Considering the scenario of developer sending the build to tester, and the product refuses to run.

- In early days, the problem of migrating builds with needed plugins was sovled by the virtual machines.
- Being heavyweight, VMs proved to be very inefficient.
- The problems that VMs had we to be addressed.
- This gave birth to the Docker.
- Docker was released in 2013
- Developed by Soloman Hykes and Sebastian Paul.
- Docker a set of PaaS.
- Docker is an open-source centralized platform designed to build, deploy, and run applications.
- Container is like a virtual machine and docker is the tool which creates this virtual machine.
- Docker is actually an engine.
- Traditionally, a VM sits on top of the hypervisor, which sits on host operating system, which again sits on top of the hardware.
- In containerization, Container sits on top of the Docker engine which then sits on OS sitting on hardware.
- Containers have dynamic memory allocation unlike VMs
- VMs made easier to move whole project environment with OS.
- Docker is just like an advanced version of virtualisation.
- Docker does containerization.
- Bare metal hypervisor is type1 hypervisor.
