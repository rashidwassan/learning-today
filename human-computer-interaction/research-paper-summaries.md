# Research Paper Summaries
### These are the summaries of different research papers that I went through in order to gain more information and understanding of Human & Computer Interactions.

## 1: On-the-move and in your car: An overview of HCI issues for in-car computing
`Summary:-`
The paper encompasses the HCI troubles which had been raised whilst communicating & computing technology had been added withinside the motors and the consumer interfaces which can be related to using situations. Also, it's far mentioned how UI may be high-quality designed to account for the excessive physical, perceptual and cognitive constraints positioned on customers via way of means of the using context. The in-vehicle UI on the premise of methods (use of simulators, instrumented vehicles) are compared & contrast. Consequently, the in-vehicle consumer interfaces and their improvement is mentioned in this paper in conjunction with the studies demanding situations which can be raised in this regard.

## 2: Research on HCI design of office chair based on QFD method
`Summary:-`
Based on QFD methodology and emotional concept, chair multi-adaptability style is developed to explore the wants of workplace users and integrate them into thought design, and eventually structural info of office chairs is obtained, in order that completely different users can use identical methods or different ways to realize the aim of use. within the whole analysis process, from the possible assumption of the demand layer to the most working of the behavior layer, it's bit by bit over that the interaction of the structure layer is natural and reasonable, which may not solely fit the physiological characteristics of office users, however also guide the user' behavior, so greatly enhancing the flexibility of the workplace chair. Through its external presentation, to a precise extent, it arouses people' health awareness and triggers the decision-making method of users. Through the analysis of office area and office behavior, office products will limit the user' behavior, thus sanctionate users to make smart behavior habits.

## 3: The Interactive Workspaces Project: Experiences with Ubiquitous Computing Rooms
`Summary:-`
This paper illustrates the initialization of study regarding the high resolution displays. Due to limited workspace, it became impossible to have an interactive workspace so they integrated this project in a computing environment. In this project, the study regarding the design of rooms containing large displays & their integration with other devices were examined carefully. The prototype of the interactive workspace was named iRoom and the software environment for this was named iROS. Also, this paper explains how the project assisted outside groups in addressing problems in their own domains and deployment of this software in their production environments.

## 4: The new normals of work: a framework for understanding responses to disruptions created by new futures of work.
`Summary:-`
This paper includes the results of a questionnaire and an interview regarding the sudden and mandatory shift of workers from the physical to the online workspace and also the challenges they faced during this transition in the wake of COVID-19. In addition to this, the paper depicts how many remote work possibilities came on the surface in this transition. Also, the snapshots of how people transitioned to remote work in the initial days of lockdown are presented highlighting both the challenges faced & the solutions or workarounds created. This paper includes the findings to bring to light the distilled strategies employed to adapt to new ways of working.
The paper also contains the possibility of a hybrid mode of working in which an individual may prefer to work remotely as well as a permanent in-person job.
Consequently, the paper covers all the necessary details of workspace transition that took place in the recent pandemic of COVID-19, initializing from the sudden & mandatory shifting to remote work and ending at the possibilities of adoption of hybrid mode of working.

## 5: Human Computer Interaction Using Hand Gestures
`Summary:-`
This paper is regarding the natural communication b/w the humans and computers. In this age, humans spend much time in interaction with the machines and tech-enthusiasts are trying their best to make this communication more & more natural. Considering the human gesture, it is a mode of non-verbal communication and this mode can provide us the most natural, original and intuitive way to interact with the machines. This paper includes the use of static hand gestures with stable and simple background effects so that a computer can recognize and then perform the required operations by recognizing those gestures. We can use these gestures to control the multimedia applications using different gestural commands.

## 6: Design and Development of Hand Gesture Based Virtual Mouse
`Summary:-`
This paper includes the establishment of techniques in order to make a virtual mouse which will be controlled through hand gestures. The main motive is to establish a complete device free mouse so the communication may become less complex. A virtual mouse system based on HCI will utilize computer vision and hand gestures. Gestures captured with a built-in camera or webcam and processed with color segmentation & detection technique. The user will be allowed to control some of the computer cursor functions with their hands which bear colored caps on fingertips. Hence, a user can perform scrolling and various clicks using hand in different gestures and consequently it will eliminate the device dependency in order to use a mouse.

## 7: Paper of choice(Interaction Devices as Assistive Technology)
Current Practices about Evaluation Methodologies
`Summary:-`
The motive of this paper is to discuss early stage evaluation of interaction devices so that the barriers b/w the user and the device can be revealed. The use of Assistance Technology (AT) is analyzed through semi-structured interviews and the findings from these interviews suggest that various dimensions are considered during the evaluation process. Besides, there are also other aspects like economical and emotional issues related to the devices. Consequently, the article ends up with the discussion of various methodologies regarding the Assistance Technology for Interaction Devices.

## 8: Tangible Interfaces for Digital Museum Applications
`Summary:-`
This paper is about the integration of tangible interfaces in the international exhibitions for giving visitors an enhanced experience in the museum. These interfaces will deliver an approach for museum storytelling in a very novel way. These interfaces were first integrated in the international exhibition at Rome and their task was to connect all these virtual objects together which were displayed at three different locations. Consequently, the usage of tangible interfaces is very important in those situations where there is diversity and separation in the objects to be displayed and we want connection b/w them for an enhanced user experience.

## 9: Embedded speech recognition system for intelligent robot
`Summary:-`
This paper is about the toy robot which contains an embedded speech recognition system which is speaker-independent. Since, this requires enough memory and high computational power so we have integrated a hardware module for this purpose. Also, it has good performance and is a speech-controlled robot. This embedded system will pave the way for better recognition capabilities in the real time systems and it will be a contribution in the natural interfaces which are meant to provide a natural way of communication in situations where the operator has to keep hands and eyes somewhere else. This system comes under the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which is crucial in cognitive behavior of machines. Consequently, speech-recognition plays a pivotal role in the cognitive behavior of machines and provides a natural way of communication.
