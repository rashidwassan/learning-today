# Human Computer Interaction

## 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design

### 1: Strive for Consistency
### 2: Cater to Universal Usability
### 3: Offer Informative Feedback
### 4: Design Dialogs to Yield Closure
### 5: Prevent Errors
### 6: Permits Easy Reversal of Actions
### 7: Support Internal Locus of Control
### 8: Reduce Short-Term Memory Load

## Foley and van Dam four-level approach
### 1: Conceptual Level
- User's mental model of the interactive system.
- Knowledge and mental models in HCI by Amir Khella.
### 2: Semantic Level
- Describes the meaning of user's command input by the computer's output display.
### 3: Syntactic Message
- How the words are arranged to construct the commands that instruct computers to perform a certain task.
### 4: Lexical Level
- Device dependencies with precise mechanisms by which a user specifies the syntax.

### Approach is convenient for the designers
- Top down nature is easy to explain.
- Matches the software architecture.
- Allows useful modularity during design.

### Dialog
- A dialog is constuction of interaction between two or more beings of a system.
- In HCI, dialogs have three levels:
  - Lexical: Shape of icons, actual key pressed.
  - Syntactic: Order of inputs and outputs in an interaction.
  - Semantic: Dialog on internal application/data is taken care of.

## Norman's Seven Stages of Action Models
1) Forming the goal
2) Forming the intention
3) Specifying the action
4) Executing the action
5) Perceiving the system state
6) Interpreting the system state
7) Evaluating the outcome
### Four principals of good design
1) visible state and alternative actions.
2) good conceptual model with consistent system image.
3) Good mappings that reveal the relationships between images.
4) User should continously recieve feebacks.

### Inconsistent action verbs
- Take longer to learn
- Cause more errors
- Slow down users
- Harder for users to remember

### The dissapearance of syntax
- Users must maintain excess of device dependant details in their human memory.
  - Which action erases a character
  - Which action inserts a new line
  - Which abbreviations are permissible
### Minimising these burdens is the goal of most interface designers
  - Standard widgets
  - Modern interface building tools

## Shneiderman's "Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design"
1) Strive for consistency
2) Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
3) Offer information feedback
4) Desing dialog to yield closure
5) Offer simple error handling
6) Permit easy reversals of actions
7) Support internal locus of control
8) Reduce short term memory load


# Understanding and Conceptualizing Interaction
HCI has moved beyond the basic designs for desktop machines.
### Understanding the problem space
1) What do you want to create?
2) What are your assumptions?
3) Will it achieve what you hope it will?

### Framework for analysing the problem space
1) What are the problems?
2) Why are those?
3) Why your ideas might be useful?
4) How would you see people using it?
5) How will it support people in their activities?
6) Will it really help them?

### Assumptions - realistic or wishlist?
1) All those things which people want are reasonable.
2) Things wihch limit or hinder interaction are not reasonable.

### From problem space to design space
- Good understanding of problem space helps in finding design space.
- Important to develop a conecptual model first.
### Conceptual Model
- How the system will appear to users?
